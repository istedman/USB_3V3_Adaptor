# USB_3V3_Adaptor
A very simple circuit to create a 3.3V supply from the +5V USB port.

I created this to derive 3.3V from a regular 5V USB port/cable, this was solely to power some development boards that are 3.3V 
only and it negated the need to have another power supply. A 3 pin linear regulator and heatsink are used.

No provision for short circuit/overcurrent has been made.
